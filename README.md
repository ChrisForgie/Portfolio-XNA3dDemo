Gp3Coursework
=============

Submission for Gp3 Coursework

The controls are shown in the start screen of the game, except for the control to turn the sound on and off, that was added after the start screen picture was created. Turning sound on and off can be done by pressing W on the keyboard or X on a Xbox 360 controller.

The game can be played with either a keyboard or a Xbox 360 controller.

The specification for the GP3 Coursework has been met with a few extras, such as user/enemy health, xbox controller support and some finer game details.

There is still some graphical issues, most notably with the back left wall in each room, also some issues with lighting when in "3rd person cam". Player and enemy movement isn't exactly fluent but it's hardly game breaking.


Objective:

Kill all the enemies in each room then progress to the final room, once all the enemies in the game are dead, you will see the game completetion screen. Watch out for your health though (shown in top-left of screen), also collision with enemies will do damage so make sure to keep your distance.
Note: You can only fire 3 bullets at a time maximum, a bullet becomes free again once it leaves the screen or collides with an enemy. "Free" bullet counter is shown under player health at the top left of the screen.
